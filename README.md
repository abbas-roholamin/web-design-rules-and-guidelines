The **designers** design a website or a webpage using design tools such as **Figma**, **AdobXD** and **Photoshop** etc. but **developer** take that design and implement it through **code**

### WHY TAKE DESIGN SERIOUSLY?

| GOOD DESIGN                                                                                                                  | BAD DESIGN                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creates an immediate and lasting **good impression** of the brand or product                                                 | Make users believe the brand **doesn't really care** about their product or service |
| Make the user **trust** the brand right away                                                                                 | Make the user **insecure** about trusting the brand                                 |
| Increases the user's **perceived value** of the brand or product                                                             | Make the brand or product seem **"cheap"**                                          |
| Gives users exactly **what they were looking for** when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information | Leaves users **confused**, and makes it **hard** to for them to reach their goal    |

### EVERYONE CAN LEARN GOOD DESIGN

Good Web desing is **not subjective or creative** everyone can learn basic by following some **rules and guidelines**

2. Colors
3. Images and Illustrations
4. Icons
5. Shadows

| ![sarif font family example](./images/sarif-font-family-example.png) | ![sarif font family example](./images/sans-sarif-font-family-example.png) |

### USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

   **SANS-SARIF**

   - Inter
   - Open Sans
   - Roboto
   - Montserrat
   - Work Sans
   - Lato

   **SARIF**

   - Merriweather
   - Aleo
   - Playfair Display
   - Cormorant
   - Cardo
   - Lora

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/), `[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)

2. It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to **2 typefaces**
3. Choose the **right typeface** according to your **website personality**

   - Choose the right personality for your website
   - Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   - Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fits your website’s message (this will come with experience)
   - You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

### USE GOOD FONT SIZES ADN WEIGHTS

1. When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices!** Use a **“type scale” tool** or other **pre-defined range**

2. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for **“normal” text**

3. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

4. For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**

5. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

### CREATE A GOODING EXPERIENCE

1. Use less than 75 characters per line

2. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and For big text, go below 1.5

   - The **smaller** or **longer** the text, the **larger** the line
     height needs to be

3. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)

4. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing

5. Usually, don’t justify text

6. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

## \#2 COLOR

### CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR

1. Make the main color **match your website’s personality**: colors convey meaning!

   - **Red Color** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
   - **Orange Color** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
   - **Yellow Color** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
   - **Green Color** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
   - **Blue Color** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
   - **Purple Color** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
   - **Pink Color** represents romance, care, and affection
   - **Brown Color** is associated with nature, durability and comfort
   - **Black Color** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. Use a **good color tone!** Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), [Flast UI Color2](https://flatuicolors.com/)

### ESTABLISH A COLOR SYSTEM

1. You need at least two types of colors in your **color palette:** a **main color** and a **grey color**

   - Grey color can be dark version of every color

2. With more experience, you can add more colors: **accent (secondary) colors** (use a tool)

3. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” **(tints and shades)**

   - Tints means **lighter** version
   - Shasdes means **darker** version

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Tinst And Shade Generator](https://maketintsandshades.com/), [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### WHEN ADN HOW TO USE COLORS

1. Use your main color to **draw attention** to the most important elements on the page

2. Use colors to add **interesting accents** or make **entire components or sections** stand out

3. You can try to use your color strategically in **images and illustrations**

### COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY

1. On dark colored backgrounds, try to **use a tint of the background** (“lighter version”) for text

2. Text should usually not be completely black. **Lighten if up** it looks heavy and uninviting

3. **Don’t make text too light!** Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
   - Contrast ratio needs to be at least **4.5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text** (18px+)

## \#3 IMAGES

### USE GOOD IMAGES

1. Different types of images: **product photos**, **storytelling photos**, **illustrations**, **patterns**

2. Use images to support your **website’s message and story**. So only use relevant images!

3. Prefer **original images**. If not possible, use **original-looking** stock images (not generic ones!)

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.com/)

### USE IMEGES WELL

1. Try to show **real people** to trigger user’s emotions

2. If necessary, **crop images** to fit your message

3. Experiment **combining** photos, illustrations and patterns

### HANDLING TEXT ON IMGES

1. **Method #1:** Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)

2. **Method #2:** Position text into neutral image area

3. **Method #3:** Put text in a box

### SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS

1. To account for **high-res screens**, make image dimensions **2x as big** as their displayed size

   - **Scale factor:** Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels

   - On high-res screens, scale factor is **2x** or even **3x**, on “normal”
     screens it’s just **1x** (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel) represented on screen

2. **Compress images** for a lower file size and better performance

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)

3. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the **exact same dimensions**

## \#4 ICONS

### USE GOOD ICONS

1. Use a good **icon pack**, there are tons of **free** and paid icons packs

   - You can just use emojis too 😁

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Phosphor Icon](https://phosphoricons.com/), [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons), [Icon8](https://icons8.com/)

2. Use only one icon pack. **Don’t mix** icons from different icon packs

3. Use **SVG icons** or **icon fonts**. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!

   | VECTOR-BASE              | BITMAP                          |
   | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
   | SVG icons and icon fonts | “Regular images”: JPG, PNG, GIF |
   | Scale indefinitely!      | Do not scale, become unsharp!   |

4. Adjust to website personality! **Roundness**, **weight** and **filled/outlined** depend on typography

### WHEN TO USE ICONS

1. Use icons to **provide visual assistance** to text

2. Use icons for **product feature blocks**

3. Use icons **associated with actions**, and **label them** (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)

4. Use icons as **bullet points**

### USE ICONS WELL

1. To keep icons neutral, **use same color as text**. To draw more attention, use **different color**

2. Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and **fit the text or action!**

3. Don't make icons larger than what they **were designed for**. If needed, **enclose them in a shape**

## \#5 SHADOW

### SOME CONCEPTS FIRST

1. After an era of 100% flat design, we’re now **back to using shadows** in UI design (“flat design 2.0”)

2. **Shadow creates depth (3D):** the more shadow, the **further away from the interface** the element is

   - Shadow can be used on **boxes** and **text**

### USE SHADOWS WELL

1. You **don’t have to use shadows!** Only use them if it makes sense for the **website personality**

   - Less shadow for peronality like **SERIOUS** or **ELEGANT** website
   - More shadow for personality like **PLAYFUL** or **FUN** website

2. Use shadows in **small doses:** don’t add shadows to every element!

3. Go **light** on shadows, don’t make them **too dark!**

### USE SHADOWS IN THE RIGHT SITUATION

1. Use **small shadows** for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)

2. Use **medium-sized shadows** for larger areas that should stand out a bit more

3. Use **large shadows** for elements that should really **float above** the interface

4. Experiment with **changing shadows** on mouse interaction (click and hover)

5. Bonus: Experiment with **glows** (colored shadows)

## \#6 BORDER-RADIUS

### USE BORDER-RADIUS WELL

1. Use border-radius to **increase the playfulness** and fun of the design, to make it **less serious**

   - Less border-radius for peronality like **SERIOUS** or **ELEGANT** website
   - More border-radius for personality like **PLAYFUL** or **FUN** website

2. Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius **matches that roundness!**

3. Use border-radius on **buttons**, **images**, **around icons**, **standout sections** and **other elements**

## \#7 WHITESPACE

### WHY WHITESPACE

1. The right amount of whitespace makes designs look **clean**, **modern** and **polished**

2. Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are **related to one another**

3. Whitespace implies **invisible relationships between the elements** of a layout

### WHERE TO USE WHITESPACE

1. Use tons of whitespace between sections

2. Use a lot of whitespace **between groups of elements**

3. Use whitespace **between elements**

4. Inside **groups of elements**, try to use whitespace **instead of lines**

### HOW MUCH WHITESPACE

1. **The more some elements** (or groups of elements) **belong together, the closer they should be!**

   - **Law of Proximity:** Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

2. Start with **a lot of whitespace**, maybe even too much! Then **remove whitespace** from there

   - oo much whitespace looks **detached**, too little looks too **crammed**

3. Match **other design choices**. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace

4. Try a hard rule, such as using **multiples of 16px** for all spacing

## \#8 VISUAL HIERARCHY

### WHAT IS VISUAL HIERARCHY?

1. Visual hierarchy is about **establishing which elements** of a design **are the most important ones**

2. Visual hierarchy is about **drawing attention** to these most important elements

3. Visual hierarchy is about **defining a “path” for users**, to **guide** them through the page

4. We use a combination of **position**, **size**, **colors**, **spacing**, **borders**, and **shadows** to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components

### VISUAL HIERARCHY FUNDAMENTALS

1. Position important elements **closer to the top the page**, where they get more attention

2. Use images mindfully, as they draw **a lot of attention** (larger images get more attention)

3. Whitespace creates separation, so **use whitespace strategically** to emphasize elements

### VISUAL HIERARCHY FOR TEXT ELEMENTS

1. For text elements, use **font size**, **font weight**, **color**, and **whitespace** to convey importance

2. What text elements to emphasize? **Titles**,**sub-titles**, **links**, **buttons**, **data points**, **icons**

   - You can also **de-emphasize** less important text, like **labels** or **secondary/additional information**

### VISUAL HIERARCHY BETWEEN COMPONENTS

1. Emphasize an important component using **background color**, **shadow**, or **border** (or multiple)

2. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by **de-emphasizing component B**

3. What components to emphasize? **Testimonials**, **call-to-action sections**, **highlight sections**, **preview cards**, **forms**, **pricing tables**, **important rows/columns in tables**, etc.

## \#9 USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

### WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE (UX)?

> Design is not just what it **looks like
> and feels like**. Design is **how it works**
>
> _– Steve Jobs_

1. **User Interface (UI)** is the visual
   presentation of a product. It’s how
   the graphical interface looks and
   feels like

   - Layout
   - Personality
   - Typography, colors, icons, etc

2. User Experience (UX) is the
   overall experience the user has
   while interacting with the product

   - Does the app feel **logical** and well thought out?
   - Does the navigation work **intuitively**?
   - Are users **reaching their goals**?

### UI AND UX DESIGN

1. **UI** is graphical interface 👉 **UI Design** is
   what makes an interface **beautiful**

2. **UX** is experience with interface 👉 **UX
   Design** is what makes an interface
   **useful and functional**

   `UX Design can not exist without UI Design!`

### UX DESIGN GUIDING PRINCIPLE: GOALS

1. A website or application **exists for a reason**: a user has a goal for **visiting** it, and a **business** has a goal for **creating** it

   - Good UX design **aligns** the **user’s goals** with the
     **business’ goals**

### UX RULES FOR USABILITY

1. Don’t design complicated layouts. Don’t reinvent
   the wheel. **Use patterns that users know**

2. Make your call-to-action the **most prominent
   element**, and make the **text descriptive**

3. Use **blue text** and **underlined text** only for **links**!
4. Animations should have a **purpose** and be **fast**:
   between 200 and 500 ms

5. In forms, align labels and fields in a **single
   vertical line**, to make the form **easier to scan**

6. Offer users **good feedback** for all actions: form
   errors, form success, etc. [web apps]

7. Place action buttons where they will **create an
   effect** (law of locality) [web apps]

8. Use a **descriptive**, **keyword-focused headline** on your main page. Don’t be vague or fancy!

9. Only include **relevant information**, efficiently! **Cut out fluff** and make the content 100% clear

10. Use **simple words!** Avoid technical jargon and “smart-sounding” words

11. Break up long text with **sub-headings**, **images**,
    **block quotes**, **bullet points**, etc.

## \#10 THE WEBSITE-PERSONALITIESFRAMEWORK

> RULES SHOULD BE APPLIED ACCORDING TO SELECTED WEBSITE PERSONALITY

1. How do you want website to ppear to users? What **“vibe”** do you want to transmit?

2. Choose one of the website personalities accordingly

3. Apply personality traits to each design ingredient
   - Typography
   - Colors
   - Images
   - Icons
   - Shadows
   - Border-radius
   - Layout

## THE 7 STEPS TO A GREAT WEBSITE

### THE PROCESS BEHIND BUILDING A WEBSITE

1. #### DEFINE THE PROJECT

   - Define **WHO the website is for**. Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?

   - Define **WHAT the website is for**. In other words, define **business and user goals** of your website project

   > **Business goal example:** Selling premium dog food
   >
   > **User goal example:** Finding high-quality dog food for good price

   - Define a target audience. Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this can come from your client)

   > **Example:** “Women, 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning over 2000€/month, with a passion for dogs”

2. #### PLAN THE PROJECT

   - Plan and gather **website content**: copy (text), images, videos etc.

   - Content is usually **provided by the client**, but you also can help them produce and find some content (simply finding free images is easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra)

   - For bigger sites, plan out the **sitemap**: what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy)

   - Based on the content, plan what **sections** each page needs in order to convey the content’s message, and in which order

   - Define the **website personality**

3. #### SKETCH LAYOUT AND COMPONENT IDEAS

   - Think about what **components** you need, and how you can use
     them in **layout patterns**

   - **Get ideas out of your head**: sketch them with **pen and paper** or with some design software (e.g. Figma )

   - This is an **iterative process**: experiment with different
     components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution

   - You don’t need to sketch everything, and **don’t make it perfect**. At some point, you’re ready to jump into HTML and CSS

4. #### DESIGN AND BUILD WEBSITE

   - Use decisions, content and sketches from Steps 1, 2 and 3 to
     **design and build the website with HTML and CSS** (“designing in
     the browser”)

   - You already have the **layout** and **components** that you selected in
     Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual **visual styles**

   - Create the design based on selected **website personality**, the
     **design guidelines** I showed you, and **inspiration**

   - Use the **client’s branding** (it if exists already) for design decisions
     whenever possible: **colors**, **typography**, **icons**, etc

5. #### TEST AND OPTIMIZE

   - Make sure website works well in **all major browsers** (Chrome,
     Firefox, Safari, Edge, maybe even old IE 😱)

   - Test the website on **actual mobile devices**, not just in DevTools

   - Optimize all **images**, in terms of dimensions and file size (👋 See
     images guidline)

   - Fix simple **accessibility** problems (e.g. color contrast issues)

   - Run the **Lighthouse** performance test in Chrome DevTools and try
     to fix reported issues

   - Think about **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO)

6. #### LAUNCH THE MASTERPIECE 🚀

   - Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval
     from your client (or yourself 😁), **it’s time to share your
     masterpiece with the world!**

   - Upload your website files to a **hosting platform**. There are
     countless platform, we will use one with a free plan (Netlify )

     brand well, is memorable and easy to write

     with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract
     (recurring revenue 🤑)

   - Install **analytics software** (e.g. Google Analytics or Fathom) to get
     statistics about website users. This may **inform future changes** in
     the site structure and content.

   - A **blog** that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users
     coming back, and is also good for SEO.

## WHAT IS RESPONSIVE DESIGN?

### RESPONSIVE DESIGN

> Design technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style to
> **any possible screen size** (window or viewport size)
>
> In practice, this means that responsive design makes websites usable on
> all devices, such as **desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones**.
>
> It’s a set of practices, **not a separate technology.** It’s all just CSS!

### RESPONSIVE DESIGN INGREDIENTS

1. #### FLUID LAYOUTS

   - To allow webpage to adapt to the **current viewport** width (or even height)

   - Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements
     that **should adapt to viewport (usually layout)**

   - Use max-width instead of width

2. #### RESPONSIVE UNITS

   - Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths

   - To make it easy to **scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically**

   - **Helpful trick:** setting 1rem to 10px for easy
     calculations

3. #### FLEXIBLE IMAGES

   - By default, images **don’t scale automatically** as
     we change the viewport, so we need to fix that

   - Always use % for image dimensions, together
     with the max-width property

4. #### MEDIA QUERIES

   - Bring responsive sites to life!

   - To change CSS styles on **certain viewport widths** (called breakpoints)
