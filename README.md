### USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

   **SANS-SARIF**

   - Inter
   - Open Sans
   - Roboto
   - Montserrat
   - Work Sans
   - Lato

   **SARIF**

   - Merriweather
   - Aleo
   - Playfair Display
   - Cormorant
   - Cardo
   - Lora

     **_TOOLBOX:_** [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/), `[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)

2. It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to **2 typefaces**
3. Choose the **right typeface** according to your **website personality**

   - Choose the right personality for your website
   - Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   - Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fits your website’s message (this will come with experience)
   - You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

### USE GOOD FONT SIZES ADN WEIGHTS

1. When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices!** Use a **“type scale” tool** or other **pre-defined range**

2. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for **“normal” text**

3. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

4. For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**

5. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

### CREATE A GOODING EXPERIENCE

1. Use less than 75 characters per line

2. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and For big text, go below 1.5

   - The **smaller** or **longer** the text, the **larger** the line
     height needs to be

3. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)

4. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing

5. Usually, don’t justify text

6. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine
