The **designers** design a website or a webpage using design tools such as **Figma**, **AdobXD** and **Photoshop** etc. but **developer** take that design and implement it through **code**

### WHY TAKE DESIGN SERIOUSLY?

| GOOD DESIGN                                                                                                                  | BAD DESIGN                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creates an immediate and lasting **good impression** of the brand or product                                                 | Make users believe the brand **doesn't really care** about their product or service |
| Make the user **trust** the brand right away                                                                                 | Make the user **insecure** about trusting the brand                                 |
| Increases the user's **perceived value** of the brand or product                                                             | Make the brand or product seem **"cheap"**                                          |
| Gives users exactly **what they were looking for** when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information | Leaves users **confused**, and makes it **hard** to for them to reach their goal    |

### EVERYONE CAN LEARN GOOD DESIGN

Good Web desing is **not subjective or creative** everyone can learn basic by following some **rules and guidelines**

### ALL DESIGN INGREDIENTS

1. Typography
2. Colors
3. Images and Illustrations
4. Icons
5. Shadows
6. Border-radius
7. Whitespace
8. Visual Hierarchy
9. User Experience
10. Components and Layout

Design decisions for each igredient are based on **website personality**

### All Website Personalities

**Design ingredients need to be applied in different ways to different website personalities.** Different personalities have different traits, therefore choices for design ingredients need to be made accordingly.

1. **Serious/Elegant:** For luxury and elegance, based on thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors, and big high-quality images

2. **Minimalist/Simple:** Focusses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons

3. **Plain/Neutral:** Design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common in big corporations

4. **Bold/Confident:** Makes an impact, by featuring big and bold typography, paired with confident use of big and bright colored blocks

5. **Calm/Peaceful:** For products and services that care, transmitted by calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, and matching images/illustrations

6. **Startup/Upbeat:** Widely used in startups, featuring medium-sized sansserif typefaces, light-grey text and backgrounds, and rounded elements

7. **Playful/Fun:** Colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand-drawn icons or illustrations, animations, and fun language

## \#1 TYPOGRAPHY

> **Typography** is the art and technique
> of arranging type to make written

### USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

   **SANS-SARIF**

   - Inter
   - Open Sans
   - Roboto
   - Montserrat
   - Work Sans
   - Lato

   **SARIF**

   - Merriweather
   - Aleo
   - Playfair Display
   - Cormorant
   - Cardo
   - Lora

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/), `[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)

2. It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to **2 typefaces**
3. Choose the **right typeface** according to your **website personality**

   - Choose the right personality for your website
   - Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   - Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fits your website’s message (this will come with experience)
   - You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

### USE GOOD FONT SIZES ADN WEIGHTS

1. When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices!** Use a **“type scale” tool** or other **pre-defined range**

2. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for **“normal” text**

3. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

4. For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**

5. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

### CREATE A GOODING EXPERIENCE

1. Use less than 75 characters per line

2. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and For big text, go below 1.5

   - The **smaller** or **longer** the text, the **larger** the line
     height needs to be

3. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)

4. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing

5. Usually, don’t justify text

6. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

## \#2 COLOR

### CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR

1. Make the main color **match your website’s personality**: colors convey meaning!

   - **Red Color** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
   - **Orange Color** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
   - **Yellow Color** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
   - **Green Color** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
   - **Blue Color** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
   - **Purple Color** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
   - **Pink Color** represents romance, care, and affection
   - **Brown Color** is associated with nature, durability and comfort
   - **Black Color** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. Use a **good color tone!** Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), [Flast UI Color2](https://flatuicolors.com/)

### ESTABLISH A COLOR SYSTEM

1. You need at least two types of colors in your **color palette:** a **main color** and a **grey color**

   - Grey color can be dark version of every color

2. With more experience, you can add more colors: **accent (secondary) colors** (use a tool)

3. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” **(tints and shades)**

   - Tints means **lighter** version
   - Shasdes means **darker** version

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Tinst And Shade Generator](https://maketintsandshades.com/), [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### WHEN ADN HOW TO USE COLORS

1. Use your main color to **draw attention** to the most important elements on the page

2. Use colors to add **interesting accents** or make **entire components or sections** stand out

3. You can try to use your color strategically in **images and illustrations**

### COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY

1. On dark colored backgrounds, try to **use a tint of the background** (“lighter version”) for text

2. Text should usually not be completely black. **Lighten if up** it looks heavy and uninviting

3. **Don’t make text too light!** Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
   - Contrast ratio needs to be at least **4.5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text** (18px+)

## \#3 IMAGES

### USE GOOD IMAGES

1. Different types of images: **product photos**, **storytelling photos**, **illustrations**, **patterns**

2. Use images to support your **website’s message and story**. So only use relevant images!

3. Prefer **original images**. If not possible, use **original-looking** stock images (not generic ones!)

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [DrawKit](https://www.drawkit.com/)

### USE IMEGES WELL

1. Try to show **real people** to trigger user’s emotions

2. If necessary, **crop images** to fit your message

3. Experiment **combining** photos, illustrations and patterns

### HANDLING TEXT ON IMGES

1. **Method #1:** Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)

2. **Method #2:** Position text into neutral image area

3. **Method #3:** Put text in a box

### SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS

1. To account for **high-res screens**, make image dimensions **2x as big** as their displayed size

   - **Scale factor:** Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels

   - On high-res screens, scale factor is **2x** or even **3x**, on “normal”
     screens it’s just **1x** (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel) represented on screen

2. **Compress images** for a lower file size and better performance

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)

3. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the **exact same dimensions**

## \#4 ICONS

### USE GOOD ICONS

1. Use a good **icon pack**, there are tons of **free** and paid icons packs

   - You can just use emojis too 😁

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Phosphor Icon](https://phosphoricons.com/), [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons), [Icon8](https://icons8.com/)

2. Use only one icon pack. **Don’t mix** icons from different icon packs

3. Use **SVG icons** or **icon fonts**. Don’t use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!

   | VECTOR-BASE              | BITMAP                          |
   | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
   | SVG icons and icon fonts | “Regular images”: JPG, PNG, GIF |
   | Scale indefinitely!      | Do not scale, become unsharp!   |

4. Adjust to website personality! **Roundness**, **weight** and **filled/outlined** depend on typography

### WHEN TO USE ICONS

1. Use icons to **provide visual assistance** to text

2. Use icons for **product feature blocks**

3. Use icons **associated with actions**, and **label them** (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)

4. Use icons as **bullet points**

### USE ICONS WELL

1. To keep icons neutral, **use same color as text**. To draw more attention, use **different color**

2. Don’t confuse your users: icons need to make sense and **fit the text or action!**

3. Don't make icons larger than what they **were designed for**. If needed, **enclose them in a shape**

## \#5 SHADOW

### SOME CONCEPTS FIRST

1. After an era of 100% flat design, we’re now **back to using shadows** in UI design (“flat design 2.0”)

2. **Shadow creates depth (3D):** the more shadow, the **further away from the interface** the element is

   - Shadow can be used on **boxes** and **text**

### USE SHADOWS WELL

1. You **don’t have to use shadows!** Only use them if it makes sense for the **website personality**

   - Less shadow for peronality like **SERIOUS** or **ELEGANT** website
   - More shadow for personality like **PLAYFUL** or **FUN** website

2. Use shadows in **small doses:** don’t add shadows to every element!

3. Go **light** on shadows, don’t make them **too dark!**

### USE SHADOWS IN THE RIGHT SITUATION

1. Use **small shadows** for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)

2. Use **medium-sized shadows** for larger areas that should stand out a bit more

3. Use **large shadows** for elements that should really **float above** the interface

4. Experiment with **changing shadows** on mouse interaction (click and hover)

5. Bonus: Experiment with **glows** (colored shadows)

## \#6 BORDER-RADIUS

### USE BORDER-RADIUS WELL

1. Use border-radius to **increase the playfulness** and fun of the design, to make it **less serious**

   - Less border-radius for peronality like **SERIOUS** or **ELEGANT** website
   - More border-radius for personality like **PLAYFUL** or **FUN** website

2. Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius **matches that roundness!**

3. Use border-radius on **buttons**, **images**, **around icons**, **standout sections** and **other elements**

## \#7 WHITESPACE

### WHY WHITESPACE

1. The right amount of whitespace makes designs look **clean**, **modern** and **polished**

2. Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are **related to one another**

3. Whitespace implies **invisible relationships between the elements** of a layout

### WHERE TO USE WHITESPACE

1. Use tons of whitespace between sections

2. Use a lot of whitespace **between groups of elements**

3. Use whitespace **between elements**

4. Inside **groups of elements**, try to use whitespace **instead of lines**

### HOW MUCH WHITESPACE

1. **The more some elements** (or groups of elements) **belong together, the closer they should be!**

   - **Law of Proximity:** Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

2. Start with **a lot of whitespace**, maybe even too much! Then **remove whitespace** from there

   - oo much whitespace looks **detached**, too little looks too **crammed**

3. Match **other design choices**. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace

4. Try a hard rule, such as using **multiples of 16px** for all spacing

## \#7 VISUAL HIERARCHY

### WHAT IS VISUAL HIERARCHY?

1. Visual hierarchy is about **establishing which elements** of a design **are the most important ones**

2. Visual hierarchy is about **drawing attention** to these most important elements

3. Visual hierarchy is about **defining a “path” for users**, to **guide** them through the page

4. We use a combination of **position**, **size**, **colors**, **spacing**, **borders**, and **shadows** to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components

### VISUAL HIERARCHY FUNDAMENTALS

1. Position important elements **closer to the top the page**, where they get more attention

2. Use images mindfully, as they draw **a lot of attention** (larger images get more attention)

3. Whitespace creates separation, so **use whitespace strategically** to emphasize elements

### VISUAL HIERARCHY FOR TEXT ELEMENTS

1. For text elements, use **font size**, **font weight**, **color**, and **whitespace** to convey importance

2. What text elements to emphasize? **Titles**,**sub-titles**, **links**, **buttons**, **data points**, **icons**

   - You can also **de-emphasize** less important text, like **labels** or **secondary/additional information**

### VISUAL HIERARCHY BETWEEN COMPONENTS

1. Emphasize an important component using **background color**, **shadow**, or **border** (or multiple)

2. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by **de-emphasizing component B**

3. What components to emphasize? **Testimonials**, **call-to-action sections**, **highlight sections**, **preview cards**, **forms**, **pricing tables**, **important rows/columns in tables**, etc.
