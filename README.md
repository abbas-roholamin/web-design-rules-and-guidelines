### USE GOOD TYPEFACES

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

   **SANS-SARIF**

   - Inter
   - Open Sans
   - Roboto
   - Montserrat
   - Work Sans
   - Lato

   **SARIF**

   - Merriweather
   - Aleo
   - Playfair Display
   - Cormorant
   - Cardo
   - Lora

     **_TOOLBOX:_** [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/), `[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)

2. It’s okay to use just **one typeface** per page! If you want more, limit to **2 typefaces**
3. Choose the **right typeface** according to your **website personality**

   - Choose the right personality for your website
   - Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
   - Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fits your website’s message (this will come with experience)
   - You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

### USE GOOD FONT SIZES ADN WEIGHTS

1. When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices!** Use a **“type scale” tool** or other **pre-defined range**

2. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for **“normal” text**

3. For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

4. For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**

5. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)

### CREATE A GOODING EXPERIENCE

1. Use less than 75 characters per line

2. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and For big text, go below 1.5

   - The **smaller** or **longer** the text, the **larger** the line
     height needs to be

3. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)

4. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing

5. Usually, don’t justify text

6. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

## \#2 COLOR

### CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR

1. Make the main color **match your website’s personality**: colors convey meaning!

   - **Red Color** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
   - **Orange Color** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
   - **Yellow Color** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
   - **Green Color** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
   - **Blue Color** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
   - **Purple Color** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
   - **Pink Color** represents romance, care, and affection
   - **Brown Color** is associated with nature, durability and comfort
   - **Black Color** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2. Use a **good color tone!** Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), [Flast UI Color2](https://flatuicolors.com/)

### ESTABLISH A COLOR SYSTEM

1. You need at least two types of colors in your **color palette:** a **main color** and a **grey color**

   - Grey color can be dark version of every color

2. With more experience, you can add more colors: **accent (secondary) colors** (use a tool)

3. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” **(tints and shades)**

   - Tints means **lighter** version
   - Shasdes means **darker** version

   **_TOOLBOX:_** [Tinst And Shade Generator](https://maketintsandshades.com/), [Paletton](https://paletton.com/), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### WHEN ADN HOW TO USE COLORS

1. Use your main color to **draw attention** to the most important elements on the page

2. Use colors to add **interesting accents** or make **entire components or sections** stand out

3. You can try to use your color strategically in **images and illustrations**

### COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY

1. On dark colored backgrounds, try to **use a tint of the background** (“lighter version”) for text

2. Text should usually not be completely black. **Lighten if up** it looks heavy and uninviting

3. **Don’t make text too light!** Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
   - Contrast ratio needs to be at least **4.5:1 for normal text** and **3:1 for large text** (18px+)
